Heb 4.12
The word of God is live and powerful, sharper than a double edged-sword, piecing through soul and spirit, through joint and marrow. It is a discerner of thoughts and intentions of the heart.

Fear not for I am with you
Do not be dismayed for I am your God
I will help you, yes I will strengthen you and
I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.

I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me
THANK YOU LORD JESUS
